== Goals

* A practical overview on the pattern usages of Containers in the world of Jenkins
** Containers can be read as "Docker". We might also cover a bit of "Kubernetes"

* You don't know Jenkins or Docker?
** Don't panic: we provide 2 "101" sessions for both

* It is a Workshop: learn by "doing"

== At Home: Getting the Workshop Lab as a local VM

* You need link:https://www.vagrantup.com/[Vagrant,window=_blank] (2.1.0+)
and link:https://www.virtualbox.org/[VirtualBox,window=_blank] (5.2.12+)
* Run the following commands to start the local VM:

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
# Getting the VM template (1 time only)
vagrant box add {box-name} {box-url}
# Initialize the environment (1 time only)
mkdir ~/{box-name} && cd ~/{box-name}
vagrant init -m -f {box-name}
# Start the lab
vagrant up
----

* Open the following URL: link:{homepage-url}[{homepage-url},window=_blank]
* Welcome to the *Lab Home Page*!

== On-Site: Getting the Workshop Lab as a Cloud VM

* We provide you a set of Cloud VMs: only web browser is required

* Access the "Instance Sheet Page",
put your name on the "Name" column to allocate the instance for yourself,
and click on the "Instance URL" link on the same line.
** link:{instance-sheet-url}[Instance sheet page,window=_blank]

with customized links
* If you click the link "Workshop Slides",
a new tab will open, to this slide-deck

== Accessing the "DevBox"
